The world is much different now. It has been a decade since our grandchildren learned to traverse time. 10 years ago they arrived with the gifts - one box mostly purple and another in yellow and green. “Source codes” they explained, before waving goodbye.
After unboxing, pulling of slivers, and a few confused attempts at construction, fighting broke out. Nobody knew what the boxes did, but everyone wanted to be the first one to figure it out.
“This plugs in right here” - “No, flip it around” - “Not with your fingers, use a tool” - “put some js on it”

Eventually everyone realized the disorganized attempt to build the thing wasn’t working. Differences were reconciled and the community formed into two groups. There were those that wanted to hire Dr. Sleezeblob McGee and his team to figure out how to assemble the thing for us, but there was an even larger number of us that wanted to keep trying to figure it out ourselves, just in a more orderly fashion.

Upon hearing that they lost the vote, the McGee camp angrily raided the Vault, taking whatever little bits of coin they could, and fled to hide somewhere in the multiverse.

With the bad guys gone, the rest of us were able to focus, build, and deploy.
Grand Openings of new XYMCity space scrapers were celebrated daily. This rapid development and adoption inevitably led to the utopian world all XYMCity residents are familiar with today.

In order to protect our wonderful XYMCity and pass it on to the future generations, we must not become complacent. If Sleezeblob McGee returns, we must remember his methods and be able to use his dark energy against him.
A utopian world can get a little boring sometimes anyway.

All citizens are encouraged to practice friendly forms of the Dark Arts.
To provide a safe environment for the practice of these dangerous actions, QUEST was founded.
With QUEST; Wizards, painters, construction workers, pirates, storytellers, and anyone can harness their carnal temptations like greed and trickery, to do good and build great things.

Everyone in XYMCity already has a great reputation. To stand out, we now instead work to grow our Connivance Score.
Your connivance score is based on your ability to trick others into offering you generous bribes for your Quests multiplied by your generosity in bribes given to others.

Formula to calculate connivance score:
Bribes Paid = X
Bribes Received = Y
X*Y/1000000

Example:
1000 XYM paid in bribes * 2000 XYM received in bribes = 2 million
2 million / 1 million = Connivance Score of 2.0

The offering and acceptance of bribes helps hone our judgment skills. With a community well versed in the arts of propaganda and grafting, we can band together in defense of outsiders looking to shill a bad idea. 

Definitions:

Bribe: (Boost)
An amount of $XYM offered to a Venturer.
Bribes are used to pay off the Venturers, helping them accomplish their Quests.

Flatlander:
Someone new to QUEST. One that has an empty connivance score.
Upon birth, it typically takes some time before a citizen develops the leg strength to do much adventuring. They first need to overcome the challenges posed by flat surfaces and mild chores, such as harvesting.

Venturer:
The Quest organizer. The one receiving bribes.
The days of a peaceable and boring life on the flatland are over. Venturers create Quests and connive fellow citizens to support them. Venturers often create light Quests, such as writing a bloody blog post or seducing a merchant to accept $XYM, but the most battle-scarred Venturers sail the stellar winds to flatten mountains, destroy the vile enemy, and fill their decks with loot. These elite Venturers reduce invading bugs to ashes and code new life with the embers of fire. The gravestones of their adversaries now a galactic cornerstone in what's become the renown XYMCity.

Accomplice:
One that offers a bribe to a Venturer. They conspire to provide financial support.
As any learned citizen will have you know, there is no better meal for a Starsnake than a lone Venturer. Without accomplices, plunder becomes blunder. Quests fail, and ‘tis a tizzy of a death. So, prepare your propaganda wisely and learn to recognize a good trick. Execute your Quests faithful, lest your plot twists.
